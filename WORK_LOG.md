| April 5    |    9-10pm     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| January 14 |  2:30-3:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                            Problem set was announced today. Spent the last half of class ideating with my tablemates. Currently considering going backwards, and using the fact that sequences are built on each other. |
| January 15 | 12:35-1:00pm  |            Slightly shifted our theory. Talked with Sierra, Lucas, and Cody, realizing that we can just start from the beginning, and then for every temperature, search all the temperatures lower than it that come earlier, and use the longest existing sequence and add one. Using the debugger, I'm getting a bug where the length of sequences is saving as zero no matter what. |
| January 15 |  1:00-1:30pm  |                                                                                                                                     It works! It took a little using of the debugger to pinpoint the problem: I wasn't assigning the first temperature any run length. A few more bugs popped up, but with those fixed, it passes the checks. Now I have to work on speeding things up. |
| January 16 |  9:00-9:30pm  |                                                                                                                                       Began working on speed ups. Current idea is to use an arraylist which store the visited temperatures in order, so that when searching everything below the current temperature, you only need to search strictly the temperatures that are lower. |
| January 16 | 9:30-10:00pm  |                                                                                               ArrayList speed up has a bug, and isn't storing anything properly. I'm going to try using the debugger line by line to see what I missed. Also, I'm not sure how to handle the ArrayList being empty, because adding the first temperature ahead of time results in it being added twice. |
| January 22 |  9:25-9:55am  |                                                              Worked on implementing the adjacency list solution. It's actually very similar to our orignial idea, except it's more broadly applicable with the implementation of an adjacency list. I'm using an array of arraylists to form my adjacency list, and I have to initialize and build it before searching for run lengths. |
| January 23 |  8:50-9:20am  | Continued implementing the solution. I got it to a point where every check was working except the longest one. It turns out that I wasn't actually using my adjacency list, and simply just using every single temperature before the current one. Somehow, this bug still passed the checks for the smaller datasets. I fixed it pretty quickly, and it passes all the checks in time! |
| January 23 | 10:00-10:15am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Cleaned up comments. |
